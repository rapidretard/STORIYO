    <p>Storiyo was borne out of the frustration of having limited options to move out of house.
      Moving out is a pain and it doesn't need to be. At Storiyo I believe that having a place
      that simplifies the moving process as much as possible is not just a nice thing to have but
      a neccesity especially in a place like Sydney where renting is not cheap and getting stuck
      in a bad place will puy
